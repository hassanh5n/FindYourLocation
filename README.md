# FindYourLocation
A Real Time Location Finder using Ipstack API in C++

# What Does It Do
As the name suggests, it tracks your IP Address and pinpoints your current location. It tells you the country and the city from where you are accessing this program.

# How It Works
Very similar to the Real Time Currency Converter, this program defines the client and builds the URL to make a HTTP request from the client who is "http://api.ipstack.com/", then handles the HTTP response and the JSON response and prints the location, type-casting from Utilty to String in the meantime.
